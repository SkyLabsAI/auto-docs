.. `Formal Methods <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods>`_ has a rich theoretical background grounded in `Category Theory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory>`_, `Program Semantics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_(computer_science)>`_ and `Logic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_in_computer_science>`_. `BlueRock Security <https://bluerock-io.github.io/formal-methods/>`_ is leveraging this body of research in order to build a framework where non-experts can productively `specify <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_specification>`_ and prove the correctness of the C++ programs they write.

This field-guide is designed to help you become proficient in the formal specification and verification of C++ programs using the BlueRock Security `BRiCk <https://github.com/bluerock-io/BRiCk>`_ tool.
This guide is *not* meant to teach research level depth in separation logic or program verification and will generally avoid deep technical content in the main tutorial text, preferring links to further reading when appropriate.
